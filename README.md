# Data Structures Programs in C Programming Language
This repository contains various programs related to data structures that I have implemented in C programming language during my college studies. The programs cover topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

Data Structures Implemented
The following data structures are implemented in these programs:

Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees
Graphs

Programs
The following is a list of programs included in this repository:

Array Operations: Program to perform basic operations on arrays, such as insertion, deletion, and searching.
Linked List Operations: Program to perform basic operations on linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, and searching.
Stack Operations: Program to perform basic operations on stacks, such as push, pop, and display.
Queue Operations: Program to perform basic operations on queues, such as enqueue, dequeue, and display.
Tree Traversal: Program to traverse a binary tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal techniques.
Graph Traversal: Program to traverse a graph using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) techniques.
